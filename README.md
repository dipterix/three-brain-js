## three-brain-js - Yet a 3D Viewer (HTML, WebGL based) for Brain

<img src="https://github.com/dipterix/threeBrain/blob/master/docs/demo.gif?raw=true" width="100%" />

This repository contains a JavaScript engine for visualizing 3D brain models via modern web browsers (with [`WebGL2` support](https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/)). The key features include:

* Visualizing surface models (FreeSurfer surface, AFNI/SUMA)
* Overlay T1 MR images as anatomical slices (FreeSurfer `.mgh/mgz`, NIfTI `.nii`)
* Overlay volume data in terms of voxel cubes (NIfTI `.nii`)
* Overlay electrodes as spheres
* Color/Animate electrodes based on their values (continuous, categorical)
* Electrode localization with CT at original resolution (paper in proceeding)
* Group-level electrode mapping (via MNI or SUMA 141 brain)

The source code currently only contains the viewer part. The data configuration files is currently generated by the R package [`threeBrain`](https://github.com/dipterix/threeBrain/). Please see "Roadmap" for details.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Jul, 2023: Finish documentation; publish electrode localization paper
- [ ] Jun, 2023: Derail R and implement JavaScript code to generate data configurations 
- [ ] Mar, 2023: Implement drivers to allow other programs to change the viewers via JavaScript events
- [X] Jan, 2023: Create initial commit for the viewer
- [X] Dec, 2022: Isolate the viewer part from R package `threeBrain`
